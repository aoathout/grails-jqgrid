Options:
  example - a valid jQuery selector for the DOM element the grid will use to get a new base size
  offset - the number of pixels added to the width of the example element, giving the grid its new width

Usage:

// make #theGrid 10 pixles smaller than #grid_wrapper
$("#theGrid").fluidGrid({ example:"#grid_wrapper", offset:-10 });
